## CC3200 - Firmware
Every board can be can be programmed in C using the Energia open source software, the firmware provided in this lesson is customized for send and receive messages using the MQTT protocol and work 

- every second send a message on the topic /
- if receive a message on topic 


## MQTT

- 


MQTT (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) is a publish-subscribe based "light weight" messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker. The broker is responsible for distributing messages to interested clients based on the topic of a message. 


## NodeRED
Node-RED is a open source visual tool for wiring the Internet of Things developed by IBM Emerging Technology and the community.

We will work on NodeRED

## NodeRED - Exercise 1 - Add an Inject node 
The Inject node allows you to inject messages into a flow, either by clicking the button on the node, or setting a time interval between injects.

Drag one onto the workspace from the palette.

 <center>![CC3200](img/inject.jpg)</center>

Open the sidebar (Ctrl-Space, or via the dropdown menu) and select the Info tab.

Select the newly added Inject node to see information about its properties and a description of what it does.

## NodeRED -  Exercise 1 - Add a Debug node

The Debug node causes any message to be displayed in the Debug sidebar. By default, it just displays the payload of the message, but it is possible to display the entire message object.

 <center>![CC3200](img/debug.jpg)</center>

## NodeRED - Exercise 1 - Wire the two together ans deploy

Connect the Inject and Debug nodes together by dragging between the output port of one to the input port of the other.

 <center>![CC3200](img/ex1.jpg)</center>

At this point, the nodes only exist in the editor and must be deployed to the server.

Click the Deploy button. Simple as that.

<center>![CC3200](img/deploy.jpg)</center>

With the Debug sidebar tab selected, click the Inject button. You should see numbers appear in the sidebar. By default, the Inject node uses the number of milliseconds since January 1st, 1970 as its payload. Letâ€™s do something more useful with that.

## NodeRED - Exercise 1 -  Add a Function node

The Function node allows you to pass each message though a JavaScript function.

 <center>![CC3200](img/function.jpg)</center>

Double-click on the Function node to bring up the edit dialog. Copy the follow code into the function field:
```{}
// Create a Date object from the payload
var date = new Date(msg.payload);
// Change the payload to be a formatted Date string
msg.payload = date.toString();
// Return the message so it can be sent on
return msg;
```

## NodeRED - Exercise 1 - Deploy

Click Ok to close the edit dialog and then click the deploy button.

<center>![CC3200](img/ex1b.jpg)</center>
 
Now when you click the Inject button, the messages in the sidebar will be more readable time stamps.

## NodeRED - Exercise 2
This example is slightly more complex and starts to bring in data from external sources to do something useful locally.

It will go out to an external web site

* grab some information
* read and convert that into a useful form
* output that in two formats, one as a JSON object for further use, and one as a boolean to switch things on and off

## NodeRED - Exercise 2 - Add an Inject node

In the previous example, the Inject node was used to trigger the flow when its button was clicked. For this example, the Inject node will be configured to trigger the flow at a regular interval.

Drag an Inject node onto the workspace from the palette.

<center>![CC3200](img/inject.jpg)</center>

Double click the node to bring up the edit dialog. Set the repeat interval to every 5 minutes on every day.

Click Ok to close the dialog.

## NodeRED - Exercise 2 - Add an HttpRequest node

The HttpRequest node can be used to retrieve a web-page when triggered.

<center>![CC3200](img/httprequest.jpg)</center>
 
After adding one to the workspace, edit it to set the URL property to:
```
http://realtimeweb-prod.nationalgrid.com/SystemData.aspx
```
You can optionally add a friendly name.

## NodeRED - Exercise 2 - Add a function node

Add a Function node with the following code:
```{}
// does a simple text extract parse of the http output to provide an
// object containing the uk power demand, frequency and time
if (~msg.payload.indexOf('<span')) {
    var dem = msg.payload.split('Demand:')[1].split("MW")[0];
    var fre = msg.payload.split('Frequency:')[1].split("Hz")[0];
    msg.payload = {};
    msg.payload.demand = parseInt(dem.split(">")[1].split("<")[0]);
    msg.payload.frequency = parseFloat(fre.split(">")[1].split("<")[0]);
    msg2 = {};
    msg2.payload = (msg.payload.frequency >= 50) ? true : false;
    return [msg,msg2];
}
return null;
```

Set the number of outputs for the function node to 2.

## NodeRED - Exercise 2 - Add a Debug node and wire them all together

Add two Debug nodes.

Wire the Inject node output to the HttpRequest node input.

Wire the HttpRequest node output to the Function node input.

Wire each of the Function node outputs to a different Debug node input.

<center>![CC3200](img/ex2.jpg)</center>

## NodeRED - Exercise 2 -  Deploy

At this point, the nodes only exist in the editor and must be deployed to the server.

Click the Deploy button.

With the Debug sidebar tab selected (Ctrl-Space, or via the dropdown menu, then click the Debug tab), click the Inject button. You should see an entry with some contents that looks like:

```(Object) { "demand": 34819, "frequency": 50.04 }```

and another with something like:

```(boolean) true```

## NodeRED - Exercise 2 - Summary

You now have a flow that goes to the Internet - gets the live UK total electricity consumption - and converts it into a JavaScript object with demand in MW, and frequency in Hertz.

The object is emitted out of the first output of the Function node.

The frequency is an indication of overall stress - so when the frequency is under 50 HZ there may be excess load on the overall National Grid. This is indicated in the message emitted out of the second output of the Function node; if the payload is true, there is capacity in the grid.

## NodeRED - Exercise 3 - MQTT

It's time to introduce MQTT nodes, they allow to receive and send messages to the configured MQTT broker.

<center>![CC3200](img/ex3.jpg)</center>
 
 Try to:
 
* send and receive a message to the topic /test/group1 (you need to check and add only wires)
* send and receive a message to the group /test/all

## NodeRED - Exercise 4 - Receive data from CC3200



## Big Data or Data Science???

 <center>![CC3200](img/conditional_risk.png)</center>
 
## Probabilistic approach

 <center>![CC3200](img/normal.jpg)</center>

## R
R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. 

## R - Exercise 1 - Receive data
Collect recoded data.

```{R}
# example for group 1, change URL using your group number
data <- read.csv("http://10.0.1.64:8001/api/dataset", header = FALSE)
names(data) <- c("Timestamp", "Board", "Temp", "TempObj",
                 "X", "Y", "Z", "RSSI", "Button1", "Button2")
# convert timestamp from Epoch to a POSIXct object
data$Timestamp <- as.POSIXct(data$Timestamp/1000,origin =
                                     "1970-01-01",tz = "CET")
# add column with hour
data$Hour <-  as.POSIXlt(data$Timestamp)$hour 

```

Try to write summary(data) on R.

## R - Exercise 1 - Plot temperature
Collect recoded data.

```{R, warning=false}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=data, aes(Temp)) +
        geom_histogram() +
        facet_grid(Hour ~ Board)
```

How we can plot TempObj?

How we can plot the difference between Temp and TempObj? What distribution remember this plot?
